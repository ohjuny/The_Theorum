Shamelessly ripped off John Green's "An Abundance of Katherines"

If you've read John Green's "An Abundance of Katherines", you know exactly what this is.

For those of you who haven't, here's a brief explanation:
Basically, it's a relationship predictor. In the book, the main character strives to determine a function that can
predict relationships (how long they last, when the relationship peeks and dips, who dumps who, etc.). So I have written
a program in Python 2.7 that calculates everything for you and outputs a formula that you can copy and paste into 
WolframAlpha's graph plotter (the link is in the program file).

SPOILERS (kind of. I would read the book before reading the rest of this.)

In the end, Colin Singleton (the main character) realises that the future is unpredictable, and the book even shows that
the formula does not work for everyone (it did not work with Colin and Lindsey). So take what the formula shows with a
pinch of salt. Don't let it affect your real relationships. I just wrote this because I thought it would be a fun side
project, and it was!

Enjoy :D
